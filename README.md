# Ray-Tracing
    We desire to create a rendering environment using C. We will implement a version of ray tracing using copious amounts of linear algebra and the power of STLs, and create beautiful images of spheres, bunnies, teapots and other objects. 

    At a minimum, we desire to implement ray tracing for a triangle or sphere, and output a grayscale image of the triangle or sphere. This will require detecting where the ray intersects the plane of triangle, calculating whether the intersected ray is contained within the triangle, and calculating the light source of the ray. 

    For a stretch goal, we want to implement volume rendering using either OpenCL or CUDA. We would also like to implement color rendering, full STL rendering, and custom environments. We would like the ability
