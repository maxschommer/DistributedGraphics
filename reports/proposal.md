## Resources
1. [Introduction to Ray Tracing](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing/implementing-the-raytracing-algorithm)

    This resource goes through a brief introduction to ray tracing, going into detail about the basic concepts such as why ray-tracing is preferable over forward tracing and how important perspective projection and light / color / shading come into play when creating 3D images on a 2D screen. It includes some pseudo-code to show an example of a ray tracing implementation, from shooting rays through pixels to adding shading to create the sense of depth.

2. [Ray Tracing](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gopi/CS211B/RayTracing%20tutorial.pdf)

    Here, we have a resource that confirms the basic concepts and implementations of ray tracing, but that also delves deeper into the math behind the algorithm. It especially elaborates on how to find the closest intersection points between the ray and the object and how to determine if a ray that bounces off of the object shoots directly into the light source (versus being blocked by another object and thus identifying shadow points). It also goes into the math formulas behind reflection and refraction, using Phong / Blinn-Phong theorems. For our stretch goal, it offers some hints as to how to approach texturing and blurring.
    
 2. [3D Basic Rendering](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/ray-tracing-rendering-a-triangle/geometry-of-a-triangle)

    This resource also touches on ray-tracing by exploring the basics of geometric rendering in 3d programs. It focuses on rendering triangles, providing details on the geometry of triangles and how to detect intersection points between the ray and the triangle. It progresses into how optimizing Barycentric coordinates helps render the objectâ€™s shading and how the Moller-Trumbore algorithm optimizes ray-triangle intersection.

Your project proposal should:

1) State the goal of your project, ideally including a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.

2) Demonstrate that you have acquired the knowledge you need to get started.  We will know that you have this knowledge if the text of the proposal uses domain language effectively to convey ideas clearly and concisely.

3) Demonstrate that you have assembled the resources you need to get started.  One good way to do that is to include an annotated bibliography with a pointer to each resource and a few sentences that describe the content.

4) Present a product backlog for the next two sprints that represents a concrete plan that will keep the entire team productively engaged (this can be a link to your Trello board).  Each item in the product backlog should represent a good sized unit of work, and have an appropriate definition of done.

 5) Enumerate potential roadblocks and ways instructors can help.  Do you need materials?  Do you have show-stopping questions you have not been able to answer?

Your primary audience is the instructors, but you should include enough background information that another student in the class could read and understand it.
