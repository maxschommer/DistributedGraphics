Your project proposal should:

1) State the goal of your project, ideally including a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.

2) Demonstrate that you have acquired the knowledge you need to get started.  We will know that you have this knowledge if the text of the proposal uses domain language effectively to convey ideas clearly and concisely.

3) Demonstrate that you have assembled the resources you need to get started.  One good way to do that is to include an annotated bibliography with a pointer to each resource and a few sentences that describe the content.

4) Present a product backlog for the next two sprints that represents a concrete plan that will keep the entire team productively engaged (this can be a link to your Trello board).  Each item in the product backlog should represent a good sized unit of work, and have an appropriate definition of done.

 5) Enumerate potential roadblocks and ways instructors can help.  Do you need materials?  Do you have show-stopping questions you have not been able to answer?

Your primary audience is the instructors, but you should include enough background information that another student in the class could read and understand it.
